# BreastCancerPredicion
Following is the EDA and classification of breast cancer whether it is benign or malignant. I have used Breast Cancer Wisconsin(Diagnostic) dataset from Kaggle.
There are 33 features. 2 features are redundant. Correlation maps are shown to compare the associativity between output feature and input features.
I have used four classification algorithms, Logistic Regression, KNN classifier, Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier. Among them Random Forest works best with 97% accuracy on the
test set.
